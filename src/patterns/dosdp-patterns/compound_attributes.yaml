description: 'Use this pattern to create compound biological attributes where
    an attribute has two primitive quality components. For example, a
    length ratio can be modelled as having two components:
    1. PATO:0000122 length.
    2. PATO:0001470  proportionality to (i.e. "ratio").
    NOTE:
    if the compound term has more than two components, for example "mass
    to height ratio", then you need to use other patterns, or a
    combination of terms created by different patterns.'

description: 'Use this pattern for traits that that depend on the
    proportions (ratios, or inverse ratios) of two measurable
    attributes. Although calculating a ratio is not commutative, the
    trait category as defined here is indifferent about the direction of
    the ratio between the two quantifiable attributes, i.e. A:B and B:A
    are assumed to represent reciprocal aspects of the same
    proportionality (as an abstract biological attribute) that share the
    same genetic determinants.
    For example, the sodium to potassium ratio is assumed to have the
    same genetic determinants in an organism as the potassium to sodium
    ratio, and the resulting reciprocal values are genetically not
    independent from each other.'
